<h1>HTML5: Elements</h1>
<!-- HTML5 Elements -->

<!-- Section -->
<!-- Represents a generic document or application section -->

<!-- Section vs Div -->
<!--
- Div elements have no semantic meaning and Section elements do
- Section is used for grouping together thematically related content
-->
<section>
    <h2>Section Tag</h2>
</section>

<!-- The Document Outline -->
<!-- It produces an outline summary of an HTML document based on its markup -->

<!-- The following elements have their own self-contained outline -->
<!--
- Article
- Aside
- Nav
- Section
-->

<!-- For example: -->
<h1>Tile
<section>
    <h2>Sub Title</h2>
</section>
</h1>
<!--
 Will produce the following output:
 1. Title
    1.1 Subtitle
 -->

<!-- Header -->
<!-- A group of introductory or navigational aids -->
<!--
 - There can be many different headers on a page
 - Generally, it appears at the top of a document or section, but it is defined by its content rather than its position
 -->
<header>
    Header
</header>

<!-- Footer -->
<!-- The footer element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element -->
<!--
- The footer element is not position-dependent
- The footer describes the content it is contained within
-->
<footer>
    Footer
</footer>

<!-- Aside -->
<!--
- Tangentially related to the content surrounding it
- When used within an article element, the aside contents should be related to that particular article
  it is contained within
- When used outside an article element, the aside contents should be specifically related to the site (sidebar)
- It represents content that is not the primary focus of an article or page,
  but it is still related to the article or page
-->
<aside>
    Aside
</aside>
<!-- Nav -->
<!--
- The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page:
  a section with navigation links
- The nav element is intended for major navigation
-->
<nav>
    <ul>
        Nav
    </ul>
</nav>
<!-- Article -->
<!--
- The article element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site
  and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable
- The article element is another type of section. It is used for self-contained related content
-->
<article>
    Article
</article>
<!-- Main -->
<!--
- Represents the main content of the body of a document or application
- The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document
  or central functionality of an application.
Warnings

- Do not include the main element inside of an article, aside, footer, header, or nav element
 -->

<!-- Figure -->
<!--
- The figure element represents a unit of content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained
- If removed, it doesn't affect the document's meaning
